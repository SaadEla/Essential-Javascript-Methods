# Javascript array Methods (Map, Reduce..-

```shell
These methods iterate over an existing object or array without using a loop
```

## Filter

filter () creates and returns a new array containing all the elements of the original array that meet a condition determined by the callback function

## Map

The map () method creates a new array with the results of calling a function supplied on each element of the calling array

## Sort

The sort () method sorts the elements of an array, in this same array, and returns the array


## Reduce

The reduce () method applies a function which is an "accumulator" and which processes each value in a list (from left to right) in order to reduce it to a single value

## Slice

Slice helps us to cut a sub array from an initial array

## Split

Split allows us to split a string into words by choosing the limit between his words

## Splice

JavaScript offers the splice method for this, which takes arguments for the index of where to start removing items, then the number of items to remove

## Concat

Concatenation means to join items end to end. JavaScript offers the concat method for both strings and arrays that work in the same way
